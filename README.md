# Crowdfunding_ETL

## Overview

This repo contains files I used and created as an extract, transform, and load exercise involving campaign finance data. This exercise involved cleaning and organizing the Contacts and Campaign CSV files and using the available data to create 2 new dataframes which were converted into CSV files (titled category and subcategory). This was done using python in Jupyter Notebook and from there, I created an entity relationship diagram (ERD) with all four CSV files to illustrate the connections between different fields. This was done using Quick DBD to establish datatypes, primary keys, and foreign keys within the datasets. I exported the the SQL schema for use in PostgreSQL (see the .sql file in the Project_2 directory) where I created a crowdfunding database with tables for each dataset and imported the corresponding data for each table using the four CSV files. Screenshots of the tables with all the imported data are included for reference.
